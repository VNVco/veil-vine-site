    <h2>Tended Spaces, Trusted Hands</h2>
    <p>
      Veil & Vine Cleaning Co. was founded with one belief: every space deserves care that’s both visible and deeply felt. Based in Columbus, Ohio, we offer residential and commercial cleaning with an approach that’s mindful, thorough, and built on trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team is trained to treat every home, office, or property with the same attention we would give our own. Whether it’s a recurring clean or a one-time deep reset, we ensure your space feels refreshed, peaceful, and well-tended.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we grow, our vision includes expanding into lawn care — offering full-service solutions that honor both the inside and outside of your sanctuary.
