    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>I started Veil & Vine Cleaning Co. with a simple intention: to create a service rooted in care, consistency, and consciousness. Our company exists to provide more than just a clean space — we aim to offer peace of mind, knowing every corner has been thoughtfully and thoroughly tended to. Whether it's a family home, a small office, or a move-in/move-out project, we approach each space with intention, respect, and a deep appreciation for the trust our clients place in us.

At Veil & Vine, we believe that the products we use are just as important as the results we deliver. That’s why we’ve carefully sourced only certified green cleaning supplies from companies who align with our core values of safety, sustainability, and environmental responsibility. This approach ensures that our services are as healthy for the planet and our clients as they are effective — creating environments that feel lighter, fresher, and genuinely cared for.

Giving back is woven into who we are. As we grow, a portion of our proceeds will go directly to supporting local animal rescues and foster-based organizations within the Columbus area. Our vision goes beyond spotless spaces; it’s about helping our community thrive in small but powerful ways. Veil & Vine isn’t just a cleaning company — it’s a quiet promise of care, delivered with every visit. </p>
